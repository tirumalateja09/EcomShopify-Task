   - Add a new service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
   - Note down your Service ID

3. **Create Email Template:**
   - Go to "Email Templates"
   - Create a new template with these variables:
     ```
     {{to_email}} - Recipient email
     {{to_name}} - Recipient name
     {{from_name}} - Sender name
     {{order_id}} - Order ID
     {{customer_name}} - Customer name
     {{customer_email}} - Customer email
     {{total_amount}} - Order total
     {{payment_id}} - Payment ID
     {{items_list}} - List of items
     {{order_date}} - Order date
     ```
   - Note down your Template ID

4. **Get Public Key:**
   - Go to "Account" â†’ "General"
   - Copy your Public Key

5. **Update Configuration:**
   - Open `src/config/emailjs.ts`
   - Replace the placeholder values:
     ```typescript
     export const EMAILJS_CONFIG = {
       SERVICE_ID: 'your_service_id_here',
       TEMPLATE_ID: 'your_template_id_here',
       PUBLIC_KEY: 'your_public_key_here',
       SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL: 'kasanitirumalateja@gmail.com'
     };
     ```

### Email Template Example:

```html
